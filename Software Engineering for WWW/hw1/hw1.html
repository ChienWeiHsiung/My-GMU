                <p>
                    With nearly 70 full-time faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest department in the College of Engineering and Computing, 
                    one of the largest departments on campus, and the largest and fastest growing CS department in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
                    <br><br>
                    The department offers two Bachelor of Science programs  with a total enrollment of over 2000 students:  the B.S. in Computer Science and the inter-disciplinary B.S. in Applied Computer Science; 
                    four M.S. programs in Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Security and Assurance, and Software Engineering with a total enrollment of 500 students; 
                    and a Ph.D. program in Computer Science with nearly 150 students. 
                    The department's faculty also teach and participate in the inter-disciplinary M.S. in Data Analytics Engineering and the Ph.D. in Information Technology offered by the Volgenau School of Engineering.
                </p>
